## Setting Up Your Environment

If this is your first time doing anything with JavaScript and the web, fear not as I will provide a step by step guide to configure your enviroment. You are welcome to use any text editor of your choosing, although I would highly recommend vs-code (not to be confused with Visual Studio).

You can get vs-code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and I would recommend the following extensions ...

- Bracket Pair Colorizer
- ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets
- Prettier - Code formatter

As well you should download the program [postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/), it will help us test our back-end routes
